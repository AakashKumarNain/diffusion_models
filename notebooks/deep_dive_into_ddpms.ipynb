Let's revisit the forward process equation and the corresponding code that we saw in the last notebook."

We proved earlier that if $x_{0}$ is known, we can show that the intermediate step in the forward process `q` are Gaussian (we will show it later). The reverse steps in `p` are also parameterized as Gaussian (check eq. (3)), hence we can say that the KL divergence term at each timestep is a comparison between two Gaussians.  The term $(q(x_{t}|x_{t-1}, x_{0})$ also serves as the GT since it defines how to denoise a noisy image ${x_{t}}$ with access to what the final, completely denoised image $x_{0}$ should be.\n",
